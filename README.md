# better-workout

Hello all! Welcome to our final project!

This is the "Better Workout Timer",
an interval training timer that helps you create and do
your workout routines better! (hopefully, lol)

The project uses React for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end.
Hopefully it all runs smoothly.

Built for HCI Team project at Georgia Southern University, Fall 2020.


**Notes for Developers (That's us!)**
 - Review the JSON file in the Resources folder to get an idea of how data should be represented. Compare it with what is in the database to make sure everything lines up.
 - Determine naming convention for evdrything so the app remains consistent everywhere. Do we call whole workouts "workouts" or do we call them "routines"? That determines what buttons like "Create Routines" would say. If routines are actually workouts, then that button's name would chanage to "Create Workouts".

 **For testing purposes**
 - To test this project run "npm start" from the command line while in the directory /../frontend/better-workout (where the node_modules is located)
 - If it does not run at first, from the same directory run "npm install" to get the required dependecies in node_modules. Then you can run npm start again.
 - The backend is currently still in production. Needs refinements to better operate with the frontend.
